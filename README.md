# GiggleCam ü¶ãüòÇ  


---

## Basic Details
### Team Name: Zoro

### Team Members
- **Anjana M M** - Government Engineering College, Kozhikode
- **Sreeparvathi M** - Government Engineering College, Kozhikode

### Project Description
**GiggleCam** is a fun, interactive web app that uses AI-powered face detection to read your expressions in real-time and respond with hilarious captions and themed images.  
And because plain humor wasn‚Äôt enough ‚Äî we added *magic*: a whimsical butterfly animation appears and disappears on mouse clicks, bringing life and chaos to the page.  
Bonus: The project starts with a splash/cover screen before the fun begins.

---

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are smiling less these days‚Ä¶ and even worse, butterflies are going extinct **on our screens**!  
Also, no one has ever complained that their webcam doesn‚Äôt make fun of them enough.

---

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We fixed it by combining **AI face detection**, **sassy captions**, **random funny images**, and **click-triggered butterflies** into one browser app.  
Now your screen can roast your face *and* give you virtual butterflies at the same time.
